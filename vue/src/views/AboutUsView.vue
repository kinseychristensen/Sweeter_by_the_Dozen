<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Where did your name come from? </h2>
<p>Sweeter by the Dozen began as a family cookbook.  Our family shares a special connection with the Gilbreth 
    family who wrote a novel in 1948 about their life with twelve children.  Our family also has twelve children, but while
    life is not exactly <i>Cheaper by the Dozen</i> these days, it certainly seems <i>Sweeter</i>.</p>

    <h2>How do you find your recipes?</h2>
    <p>Any recipe posted by 'theOriginalDozen' are recipes from our personal family recipe collection.  Some were created by our 
        family members, some were contributed by neighbors, and some are historic recipes from our great grandparents.  Where we do have
    record of the original source, we include that in the attribution. If there is a recipe that you know the attribution for, please <a href="mailto:sweeter.by.the.dozen.cookbook@gmail.com">send 
    us an email</a> so that we can properly give credit to the original writers.</p>

    <h2>Why do you not have any way to search by 'healthy' or 'diet' recipes?</h2>
    <p>Every food can have a good purpose.  Every body has a different set of nutiritional needs.  And every person has different prefrences and needs 
        based on their own culture, beliefs, and morals.  We don't ever want to 'yuck' someone else's 'yum'.  On the same hand, we do not want to 
        encourage language or ideas that can contribute to disordered eating.  For some bodies, a healthy choice that day is something with lots of 
        dense mineral content so they need nuts or beans or dark chocolate.  For a differnt body, their healthy choice might be to have foods with high fat content
        like cheese and yogurt and bacon.  And for a different body their healthy choice might be a warm chocolate chip cookie that reminds them of a friend.  
        Your choices for your body are your choices to make.  We do not want to purporte any specific dietary choice as being superior to any other.
